Solve this murder mystery using only command line programs.

To figure out who-done-it, go to the 'mystery' subdirectory and start
collecting all the clues from the 'crimescene' file.

The officers on the scene were super meticulous and wrote down EVERYTHING in
their reports. Fortunately, their sergeant went through and marked the real
clues with the word "CLUE" in all caps.

Refer to the `cheatsheet` file for some tips on commands and concepts you may
find useful:

  less cheatsheet

The `less` command will print the contents of the `cheatsheet` file to the
Terminal one page at a time. When working in `less`:

- Press the Up and Down arrow keys to scroll one line at a time.
- Press the F and B keys to scroll one page at a time.
- Press the Q key to quit and return to the shell.

If you get stuck, you can read the files in the `hints` directory, which are
ordered from least to most damaging.

When you think you've solved the mystery, execute the following command from
inside the project root (i.e. the 'clmystery' directory), replacing "John Doe"
with your suspect's name:

  ./check "John Doe"

Good luck, detective!
