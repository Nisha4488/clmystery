wrote down EVERYTHING in their reports. However, their sergeant went through the
`mystery/crimescene` file and marked the real clues with the word "CLUE" in all
capital letters.

witnesses and, ultimately, identify the murderer. If you get stuck, you can
read the files in the `hints` directory.

When you've identified the murderer, run the `check` command from inside the
root `clmystery` directory, replacing "John Doe" with your suspect's name:

  ./check "John Doe"
