Use the `grep` command to find a vehicle with a matching license plate, make,
or color from the `mystery/vehicles` file:

  grep L337 mystery/vehicles

  grep Honda mystery/vehicles

  grep Blue mystery/vehicles

This doesn't give you anything useful. Why not? Try using the `head` command on
the file to investigate its structure. Then, see the `cheatsheet` file for more
information on the `grep` command and its flags.
