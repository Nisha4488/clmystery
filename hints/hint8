To see who's a member of several different groups, combine the membership lists
using the `cat` command and pipe its output into the `grep` command.

  cat AAA Fitness_Galaxy United_MileagePlus | grep "John Smith"

If you only want to see the number of matches, use the `grep` command's -c flag:

  cat AAA Fitness_Galaxy United_MileagePlus | grep -c "John Smith"
