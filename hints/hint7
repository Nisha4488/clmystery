In order to actually get information about vehicles that might match the description, you need to get multiple lines AROUND each match. Use the -A, -B or -C option with grep:

  grep -A 5 "L337" mystery/vehicles

This will match the license plates that contain "L337" and, for each match, show us the five lines AFTER it.
