To get useful information about a vehicle from the `grep` command, you'll need
to include multiple lines around each match using the -A, -B, or -C flags:

  grep -A 5 L337 mystery/vehicles

This will match the license plates that contain L337 and, for each match, show
the 5 lines AFTER it. See the `cheatsheet` file for more information about each 
of these flags.
