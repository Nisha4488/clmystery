To interview the two possible witnesses, use the `head` and `tail` command to
read the correct line from their corresponding street file:

  head -n 173 mystery/streets/Mattapan_Street | tail -n 1

This command sequence will print line 173 of Mattapan street. The `head`
command prints out the first 173 lines and the `tail` command will print the
last line of those.
